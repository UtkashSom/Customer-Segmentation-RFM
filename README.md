### 📊 Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis & K-Means Clustering

This repository presents a customer segmentation project using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis combined with **K-Means clustering** in Python. The aim is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior to enable targeted marketing and personalized customer strategies.

#### 🚀 Key Highlights
- 🔄 **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and transform transactional data for analysis  
- 📐 **RFM Metric Calculation**: Compute Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer  
- 🔍 **Feature Scaling**: Normalize RFM values for effective clustering  
- 📊 **Segmentation using K-Means**: Apply K-Means clustering to segment customers based on RFM features  
- 📈 **Visualization**: Explore and interpret clusters using various visual tools  
- 📌 **Insights**: Extract meaningful insights from clusters to guide business decisions

#### 🧠 Techniques Used
- RFM Score Generation  
- Elbow Method for optimal cluster selection  
- K-Means Clustering  
- Data visualization
  
#### 📂 Repository Structure
- `data/` – Raw and cleaned datasets  
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter Notebooks with detailed analysis  
- `scripts/` – Core functions for RFM calculation and clustering  
- `outputs/` – Cluster summaries and visualizations

#### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (for KMeans, scaling, metrics)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)  

#### 📈 Example Segments
- Cluster 0 – High-value loyal customers  
- Cluster 1 – New but promising customers  
- Cluster 2 – At-risk or inactive users  
- (Segments may vary depending on clustering)
